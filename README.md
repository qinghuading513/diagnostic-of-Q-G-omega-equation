# diagnostics of the Q-G omega equation
This contains a set of Fortran codes used to diagnose the contributions of three processes to the long-term trends in vertical motion over the region of interest, based on the traditional Q-G omega equation (Eq1) and ERA5 daily (or 6-hourly) data
                (∇_p^2+(f_0^2)/σ  ∂^2/〖∂p〗^2   )ω=f_0/σ  ∂/∂p [V_g∙∇_p (ζ_g+f)]+R_d/σp∇_p^2(V_g∙∇_p T)+R_d/σp ∇_p^2 (-Q)     Eq. 1
 
 omega.term1.f is a Fortran code to calcualte term1 in our Eq.1
